Welcome to FastType.
This is a small test file to show you what this tool can do.
You are currently in "Focus Mode".
This means the line you are typing always stays right in the center.
The text also shifts horizontally so your eyes never have to search.
Try making a typo: The character will turn red.
If you type correctly, the text turns a beautiful green.
A key feature is saving:
Need to go? Just press the ESC key.
The program will quit and remember exactly where you left off.
Next time you start, you can continue right from there.
Have fun typing and getting faster!

PS. There will be a WPS and accuracy stat in the future, so stay tuned.
